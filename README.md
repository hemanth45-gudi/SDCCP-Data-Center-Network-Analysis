# 🖥️ Data Center Network — Scalable and Cost-Effective Architecture Study

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a case study on designing **flexible, highly scalable, and cost-effective network structures for Data Centers**. It analyzes the limitations of traditional Data Center Network (DCN) architectures such as Fat-Tree, which are often rigid, expensive, and difficult to scale.

The study introduces a new network topology called **SDCCP (Scalable Data-Center Network based on Cartesian Product)**. This architecture provides a modular and scalable design that supports incremental expansion, reduces infrastructure cost, and improves energy efficiency while maintaining high network performance.

The project demonstrates how modern data center networks can be optimized to handle increasing demand while reducing operational costs.
