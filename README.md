Project Name :Data Center Network

This case study, titled "Flexible, Highly Scalable and Cost-Effective Network Structures for Data Centers" , analyzes the challenges of scaling traditional Data Center Networks (DCNs) like Fat-Tree which are often rigid, expensive, and difficult to expand. The project introduces a novel topology, SDCCP (Scalable Data-Center network based on Cartesian Product) , which uses a modular design for low-cost, incremental expansion. SDCCP is shown to achieve an excellent compromise between performance, cost, and expandability , resulting in lower cost per server port and a reduction in energy consumption by approximately 27-35% compared to other architectures. The core goal is to design a DCN that remains flexible, scalable, and cost-effective while ensuring high performance and energy efficiency.
